  <p> I am blessed to be supervised by kind and experienced mentors during my career life, who taught me not only
    technically but also mentally. I will also teach my students like them. Below is a brief introduction of my mentors:

          <p> Prof. Timothy M. Jones is a Professor at the University of Cambridge Computer Laboratory, as well as
            Fellow and 1956 College Lecturer at Gonville and Caius college where he is joint Director of Studies (DoS)
            for Computer Science. Tim's research focuses on extracting the many different forms of parallelism from
            applications (e.g. thread-level, data-level, memory-level) to increase performance and address
            energy-efficiency and reliability challenges within compilers, binary translators and microarchitectures.
          </p>
          <p> Tim has been my mentor (2021 - 2024) throughout my postdoctoral research in processor architecture and
            security, offered valuable insights and guidance as I investigate fundamental concepts and stay abreast of
            emerging trends in these areas.</p>
